### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `stripe`

### Installation
```bash
pip install requests stripe
```

### API Keys
Set your API keys as environment variables:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set SQUARESPACE_API_KEY=your-squarespace-api-key-here

## Pending Order Count Script

**File:** `pending_order_count.py`

This script connects to the Squarespace API to count panel and swatch book products from pending orders. It provides detailed breakdowns by product type, variant specifications, and SKUs.

### Features
- **SKU-based counting** for precise product identification
- **Variant details** including sizes, weights, leather types (Dublin, Glove, etc.)
- **Separate tracking** of panels and swatch books
- **Detailed output** with product names, variant descriptions, and SKU references

### Usage

```bash
python scripts/pending_order_count.py
```

### Example Output

```
Panel counts:
  Horween Dublin Leather Panels (Size: 2′ Panel - Weight: 3-4 oz) [SKU: SQ5172253]: 1
Total panels: 1

Swatch book counts:
  Horween Swatch Books (Swatch Book: Dublin) [SKU: SQ6839957]: 1
  Horween Swatch Books (Swatch Book: Glove) [SKU: SQ0776396]: 1
Total swatch books: 2
```

### Configuration
- By default, fetches orders with "PENDING" fulfillment status
- Modify the script to change fulfillment status or add date filters if needed

## Migrate Sortly Inventory

This script is a POC of how we can use LLM intelligence in order to differentiate between multi-worded colors and materials. Purposed to migrate the current sortly inventory to any other chosen platform once Shopify is migrated to.

## Payment Fetch Script (EOM Billing Report)

**File:** `payment_fetch.py`

This script pulls transaction data from both Stripe and PayPal for end-of-month (EOM) billing reports. It provides comprehensive summaries with breakdowns by payment source and supports CSV export.

### Features
- **Multi-source support** - Fetches from Stripe and PayPal simultaneously
- **Read-only operations** - Cannot create, modify, or delete transactions
- **Detailed summaries** - Shows gross revenue, fees, net revenue, and fee rates
- **CSV export** - Save data for further analysis
- **Date range filtering** - Specify custom date ranges or use defaults

### Prerequisites
Set up your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Required for Stripe
export STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_key_here

# Required for PayPal
export PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
export PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret

# Optional: Set to 'sandbox' for PayPal testing (defaults to 'live')
export PAYPAL_MODE=live
```

### Usage

```bash
python scripts/payment_fetch.py [options]
```

### Options

```
--start-date START_DATE    Start date (YYYY-MM-DD). Default: 30 days ago
--end-date END_DATE        End date (YYYY-MM-DD). Default: today
--source {stripe,paypal,both}  Payment source to fetch. Default: both
--csv                      Export results to CSV file
```

### Example Usage

## Squarespace to QuickBooks Integration

**File:** `scripts/squarespace_to_quickbooks.py`

Automatically import Squarespace orders as QuickBooks Desktop invoices with product mapping, customer matching, and location-based tax calculation.

### What It Does

✅ Fetches orders from Squarespace (single, multiple, or batch)
✅ **Maps products by name** to QuickBooks items (no SKUs needed!)
✅ **NEW: Variant mapping** - Maps products with attributes (tannage, color, weight)
✅ **Extracts pieces** from order customizations/variants
✅ **Captures all fields**: Item, Description, Quantity, Pieces, Price
✅ **Location-based tax** (in-state vs out-of-state)
✅ Smart customer matching (email/phone/name) to avoid duplicates
✅ Auto-creates new customers with full contact info
✅ Flags new customers in separate report
✅ **REP = "SHOP"** and **SHIP VIA = "UPS"** (hardcoded)
✅ **Flexible invoice numbering** - blank (default) or use Squarespace order numbers
✅ **Daily automation** - saves to RDP or emails files

### Quick Start

**1. Set Environment Variables:**
```cmd
set SQUARESPACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
set SHIP_FROM_STATE=GA
```

**2. Create Product Mapping** (optional - edit `sku_mapping.csv`):
```csv
SquarespaceProductName,QuickBooksItem
Horween Dublin Leather Panels,Premium Leather Hide
Brass Hardware Set,Brass Buckle Set
Leather Panel - Horween Predator - Steel - 5-6 oz,Predator Steel 5-6 oz
Leather Panel - Italian Nubuck - French Navy - 3.5-4 oz,Italian Nubuck French Navy
```
**Note:** Supports both simple product mappings and variant-specific mappings (tannage, color, weight)

**3. Run Import:**
```cmd
# Orders fulfilled today
python scripts\squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --fulfilled-today

# Specific order(s)
python scripts\squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --order-numbers 1001
python scripts\squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --order-numbers 1001,1002,1003

# Date range
python scripts\squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-01-31

# OPTIONAL: Use Squarespace order numbers as QB invoice numbers with "SS-" prefix (instead of blank)
python scripts\squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --fulfilled-today --use-ss-invoice-numbers
```

**4. Import to QuickBooks:**
- File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files
- Select the generated `.iif` file (customers first, then invoices)
- Invoices will import with BLANK invoice numbers (unless you used `--use-ss-invoice-numbers`)

**5. Assign Invoice Numbers:**
- **Default (blank):** In QuickBooks, find invoices with blank numbers and manually assign sequential invoice numbers
- **Optional:** Use `--use-ss-invoice-numbers` flag to automatically use Squarespace order numbers
- **Why blank is default?** Prevents conflicts in multi-user RDP environments where concurrent imports could override invoice numbers

### Key Features

- **Product Name Mapping**: Map Squarespace products to QB items (no SKU required)
- **Variant Mapping**: Map products with multiple attributes (tannage, color, weight) to specific QB items
- **Unmapped Products Tracking**: Auto-generates report of products without mappings
- **Pieces Extraction**: From customizations/variants in Squarespace API
- **Location-Based Tax**: Compare ship-to vs ship-from state
- **Customer Matching**: Smart duplicate detection by email/phone/name
- **Flexible Invoice Numbering**: Blank by default (manual), or use Squarespace order numbers with `--use-ss-invoice-numbers`
- **Daily Automation**: Auto-generate IIF files for fulfilled orders
- **Flexible Import**: Single, multiple, or batch by date range
- **REP & SHIP VIA**: Automatically set to "SHOP" and "UPS"

### Field Mapping

| QuickBooks | Squarespace | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Date | `createdOn` | Invoice date |
| Invoice # | *(blank or SS-####)* | Blank by default, or "SS-1001" format with `--use-ss-invoice-numbers` |
| Customer | `billingAddress` | Smart duplicate detection |
| Ship To | `shippingAddress` | Full address |
| Ship Date | `fulfilledOn` | Fulfillment date |
| Ship Via | *(hardcoded)* | Always "UPS" |
| REP | *(hardcoded)* | Always "SHOP" |
| Item | `productName` → mapped | Via `sku_mapping.csv` |
| Description | `productName` + `variantOptions` | Full description |
| Quantity | `quantity` | Normal integers |
| Pieces | `customizations` or `variantOptions` | Extracted from API |
| Price | `unitPricePaid.value` | Unit price |
| Taxable | Ship-to vs Ship-from state | Y/N based on location |

### Generated Reports

After each import, the script generates helpful reports:

📄 **`*_NEW_CUSTOMERS.txt`** (always generated)
- Lists all new customers that will be created in QuickBooks
- Includes contact info for verification

📄 **`*_UNMAPPED_PRODUCTS.txt`** (if any unmapped products found)
- Lists products without mappings in `sku_mapping.csv`
- Shows what QB item names will be auto-created
- Provides suggested mapping entries to add
- **⚠️ Review this before importing to avoid unwanted QB items!**

### Invoice Numbering Workflow

**Invoice Numbering Options:**

**Option 1: Blank Invoice Numbers (Default - Recommended)**
- Invoices import with blank invoice numbers
- You manually assign sequential numbers after import
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents conflicts in multi-user RDP environments
  - Gives you full control over sequential numbering
  - No risk of overriding existing QB invoice numbers

**Option 2: Use Squarespace Order Numbers (Optional)**
- Add `--use-ss-invoice-numbers` flag when running the script
- Uses Squarespace order numbers with "SS-" prefix (e.g., "SS-1001", "SS-1002") as QB invoice numbers
- **Benefits:**
  - Automatic - no manual numbering needed
  - Perfect traceability between Squarespace and QuickBooks
  - Prefix prevents conflicts with existing QB invoice numbers
- **Trade-offs:**
  - Non-sequential in QuickBooks (gaps based on which orders you import)
  - Different numbering format than your regular QB invoices

**How to batch-number invoices after import:**

1. **Find blank invoices:**
   - In QuickBooks Desktop, go to: Reports > Banking > Missing Checks
   - Change account to: Accounts Receivable
   - This shows all invoice numbers (or blanks) in your A/R account

2. **Assign numbers:**
   - Open each invoice with a blank number
   - Type your desired invoice number (e.g., next sequential number)
   - Click Save & Close
   - QuickBooks will continue the sequence for future invoices

3. **Alternative - Batch edit:**
   - Sort invoices by date or customer
   - Number them sequentially in one session
   - Maintains proper audit trail

**💡 Tip:** Import all Squarespace invoices in one batch, then number them all at once for efficiency.
