# HOW TO EXPORT CUSTOMERS FROM QUICKBOOKS

This file explains how to export your customer list from QuickBooks Desktop
so the script can match existing customers and avoid duplicates.

## Steps to Export Customers:

1. Open QuickBooks Desktop

2. Go to: Reports > List > Customer Contact List

3. Click "Excel" button (or "Export")

4. Choose "Create New Worksheet"

5. Save as CSV file (e.g., "qb_customers.csv")

6. Make sure the export includes these columns:
   - Name (customer name in QB)
   - Email
   - Phone or Phone Number
   - Contact or Full Name (optional)

## Using the Customer File:

Run the script with the --customers flag:

    python squarespace_to_quickbooks.py --customers qb_customers.csv

## What the Matching Does:

The script will try to match Squarespace orders to existing QB customers by:

1. Email (most reliable) - exact match
2. Phone number - normalized (removes spaces, dashes, etc.)
3. Last name - if only one customer with that last name
4. Last name + First name - if multiple matches, checks first name too

If a match is found, it uses the existing customer name from QuickBooks.
If no match, it creates a new customer.

## Alternative: Manual Export

If the Customer Contact List report doesn't work, you can also:

1. Go to: Lists > Customers
2. Export the customer list
3. Make sure it's saved as CSV with at least: Name, Email, Phone columns
