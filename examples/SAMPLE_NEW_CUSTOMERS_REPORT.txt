HOW THIS WORKS:
- These customers will be CREATED when you import the IIF file
- QuickBooks will add them with full contact information
- Their invoices will be created immediately after
- If a customer name already exists in QB, it will be skipped

WHAT TO DO:
1. Review this list to ensure names/emails are correct
2. Check for any potential duplicates (similar names)
3. Import the IIF file into QuickBooks
4. Verify new customers were created properly in QB
